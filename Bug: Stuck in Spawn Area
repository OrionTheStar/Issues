Welp, I was playing on a 1.7.10 server I like when I accidentally clicked on this server. I logged in and after seeing that there didn't 
appear to be any issues I tried killing a couple mobs. Everything worked out fine. Then, I logged out and came back later, and
spawned in the dark wool room that you usually start with with my gear. Other players were coming in and teleporting off and
I'm still stuck in here.
